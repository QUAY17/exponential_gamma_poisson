# exponential_gamma_poisson

Calculus based Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists. 
In this lab, I explore the continuous distribution exponential, as well as the discrete geometric distribution (found by rounding the exponential values). I then compute poisson and gamma distributions.
